# Alfontzo
> Machine-dependant font configuration for Emacs

### Initial Idea
I use Emacs across different machines across the day
(Macbook at work with Retina displays, Macbook Air at home,
Linux machine at home with an older 1280px display). On each
machine, I prefer a different font size, that results from
the used display resolution.
